English won.

It might not be the best pick as the "international language" but it's still a great pick.

Nearly anybody can speak some English today and it's improving every day.

Try to only use English when possible.

Context-switching is hard -- don't speak a mix of two languages at once.

English texts are more accessible to humanity as a whole and won't disappear as fast as other languages.
