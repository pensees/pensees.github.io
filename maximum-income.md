No one's total income shall be over $60k a year¹ -- regardless of their skills, age, location and so forth.

$5,000 a month per person shall be enough to live anywhere in the world.
It would:

- push people out of overvalued cities like London and San Francisco;
- make many startups more sustainable by having a reasonable burn rate;
- force companies to reinvest extra profit into growth, other projects, donations, etc.

This obviously applies to everyone -- including government officials, queens and presidents.
