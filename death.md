YOU WILL DIE.
And so will every single person you've ever known -- including your parents, siblings and children.

So make the most of your life while you can.
That doesn't mean to be reckless though.

A good test is to ask yourself how you'd react if next week you hear you have an incurable cancer with six months left to live.
If your answer is "oh no it's too soon", you're doing it wrong.

You shall not regret *not* having done things.
