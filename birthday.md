There is little point in celebrating your birthday.
What are you celebrating anyway?
That you're still alive?

To give credit where credit is due, mothers do all the heavy lifting, and they're the ones who should be celebrated.

Suggestion: Each year on your birthday, reach out and say thanks to people who have had a positive impact on your life -- including your mother.
