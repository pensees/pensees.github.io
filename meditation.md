Meditation is different than concentration and thinking.
Meditation makes you more self-aware.
Meditation is hard.

Meditation can be learnt within two weeks if doing it all day long and being in the right environment.

Meditating on a daily basis is hard but it will be immensely rewarding and improve your life significantly.
