Why do you wake up?
Why don't you stay in bed?
What does excite you?

Define clear motivations and goals to make you eager to kick off your day.

If you need an alarm clock to get out of bed, you're not living a fulfilled life.

Examples:

- <q>Why do I wake up today? I'm gonna paint my bike. I always wanted to do it.</q>
- <q>Why do I wake up today? I'm gonna hone my craft. I love building violins!</q>
