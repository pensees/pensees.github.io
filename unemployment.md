Don't worry about what the TV tells you, unemployment is not to be feared!

The day most jobs will be automated away by machines and computers, humanity will finally have time to pursue grander interests such as art, peace, spirituality, harmony, spending time with each other, etc.

The Luddites were already scared about that in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
History has shown their fears were unfounded.
Unless you want to go back to a world without cars, trains and planes?

One hundred years from now, most people should be unemployed.
Their (basic) needs will be covered by some kind of universal income.
