Happiness according to Socrates:
<q>The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.</q>

Happiness according to Epicurus:

- have some close friends
- have enough income for your basic needs
- take time to reflect about life -- regularly

Happiness is the opposite of boredom.
