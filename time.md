Time does *not* fly by.
Routine makes time fly by.

**Perceived time is measured in proportion to newness coming into your life.**
Hence childhood seemed longer than the years show.

Goal: **get constant newness in your life so it feels long, full and properly lived.**

Time is the only limited resource.
Aim to spend it doing what you truly want and being yourself.

Time is more valuable than money.
You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.
