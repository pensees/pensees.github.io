title: Excuses
---

Excuses are lame.
You have no excuses.

Examples:

- <q>Because I am young.</q>
- <q>Because I am old.</q>
- <q>Because I am black.</q>
- <q>Because I am white.</q>
- <q>Because I am male.</q>
- <q>Because I am female.</q>

The truth is <q>because you are being lazy/scared</q>.
Just do it!
