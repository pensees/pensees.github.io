The only constant is change.

Be the change you want to see in the world.

Examples:

- Want more colors in my life? Wear colorful clothes.
- Want people to talk to each? Talk to people.
- Want less cars and more bikes? Use a bike.

If you complain about something you can change, change it.
If you complain about something you cannot change, what's the point of complaining?

Don't replicate old habits without questioning them.
