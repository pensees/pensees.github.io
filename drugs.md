Drugs are any substance which may be a struggle to quit using.

Examples:

- sugar
- coffee
- alcohol
- tobacco
- coke, heroin and other hard drugs

You should try to quit any drug you're using on a regular basis to make sure you actually can quit should you want to.

Example: Try to not drink coffee for two weeks.

On another note, nobody shall tell you which substance you can or cannot put in your own body -- and that applies to governments as well.
