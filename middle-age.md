We like to think we're "civilized".
I'd argue we are still living in the Middle Age.
People from year 3000 will see us like we see the barbarians from year 1000.

Things change. In the future, many things will likely disappear:

- keys
- banks
- personal cars
- drivers
- retail jobs
- universities
- companies
- governments
