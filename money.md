Have an emergency fund.
Have some savings.
Spend less than you earn.
Make sure you save at least 10% of your income.

Being below your comfort zone will make you stressed out and dumber.
Make sure you have enough in the kitty so you won't worry about how to pay the rent.
Living paycheck-to-paycheck will put you in a constant state of anxiety and stress.

Banks shall not be given blind trust with anything, including your life savings.
