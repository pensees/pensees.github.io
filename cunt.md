Words are just words.

Cunt. Shit. Bitch. Fuck. Ass.

Words are **not** offensive by nature.
It's the way you say it that can make it offensive.

<q>He's a good cunt.</q> -- A friendly Kiwi.

<q>You're an absolute cunt!</q> -- An angry Kiwi.

"The F-bomb" is just a way to make the listener say "fuck" in their head.
Stop being a little cunt and say the damn word already.

PS: "BS" is not less offensive than "bullshit". Same shit.
