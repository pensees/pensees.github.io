Honesty is paramount.

Don't bullshit anyone.

Smart people are never afraid to say <q>I don't know</q> or <q>I don't understand, please explain</q> or <q>I'm confused aboutâ€¦</q>

If you make a habit to be honest about this instead of pretending to understand something you don't, you'll find it's hard to for other people to lie to you.
