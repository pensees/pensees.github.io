Elections in the West are pointless.
They only give the illusion of choice.
Whoever the winner is won't change anything for 99% of citizens.

Voting for the "least bad" candidate is stupid.
If nobody suits you, just vote blank.

As long as the majority of people vote for someone, that someone can always argue they've been elected by the people.
Are you unhappy with your political leader?
Well, you voted for them, remember.
So shut the fuck up or vote blank next time.

Only when 50%+ of ballots are blank, things will start to change.
