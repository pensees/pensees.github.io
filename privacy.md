<q>I have nothing to hide</q> is an outrageous lie.

Everybody has something to hide.

If you truly have nothing to hide, then give me your online banking and email passwords.
I will sign you a legally binding contract to **solely** have a look around without doing any harm.
If you truly have nothing to hide, that should not be a problem at all.
So, do we have a deal?

If yes, then I would argue that it's not only about you.
Would you like to live in a society where journalists and activists can't expose controversial topics at the risk of being prosecuted?

Moreover, knowing most of your life can and is monitored will make you behave differently and induce in self-censorship.
