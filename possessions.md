The things you own end up owning you.

The more possessions you own, the less freedom you have.

One ought to live with 50 material things or less.
This allows to put *all* your stuff in a single carry-on backpack and be free to travel to the other side of the world tomorrow.

Suggestion:

- Spread *all* your possessions on your bed;
- Take a picture;
- Get rid of anything not required to travel around the world tomorrow;
- Take another picture;
- Feel the freedom growing into you.
